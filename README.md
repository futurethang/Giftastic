## Project Goals

* Populate a number of pre-set selection button from an array.
* Allow user to add additional buttons with keywords of their choosing.
* When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.
* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it will stop playing.
* The Gif's rating is displayed when hovered over

### Challenges

This project served as yet another reminder of how tricky front end development can be! The focus (first and foremost) was to utilize jQuery with API calls to make a dynamic user environement that updates and responds by adding and modifying content. Simply producing a grid of gifs is adequate, and my desire to present a bit more flair led me to some compromises, both in the end product and the amount of time I spent working on this project. DOM manipulation to display ratings and allow the playback to start and stop was tricky to figure out, but provided some valuable lessons.
